# Smart-Condo-Annotations-Project

**The Smart Condo**
===================

The Smart Condo is a research facility located in the Edmonton Clinic Health Academy. It is used to simulate home visits, allowing healthcare professionals to increase their understanding of assisted living devices. The condo features intelligent technologies, such as sensors and smart appliances, providing opportunities for researchers and practitioners to learn how to communicate and collaborate with patients living in 'intelligent' homes.

**Project Purpose**
===================

This project's goal was to develop a code that provides users a method to add and retrieve different annotations in order to enhance the exploration of the Smart Condo's virtual 3D model. The keyboard's arrow keys are utilized to move the first-person controller while the mouse's cursor rotates the camera's direction of view. 


**Opening Project File**
========================

The Smart Condo Annotations is a Unity Project file. Upon opening the file in Unity, open the scene named "Condo". The way that the components of the annotation window are positioned, the Game window must be full-screen horizontally.
