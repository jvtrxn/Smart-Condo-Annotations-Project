# Smart-Condo-Annotations-Project

**The Smart Condo**
===================

The Smart Condo is a research facility located in the Edmonton Clinic Health Academy. It is used to simulate home visits, allowing healthcare professionals to increase their understanding of assisted living devices. The condo features intelligent technologies, such as sensors and smart appliances, providing opportunities for researchers and practitioners to learn how to communicate and collaborate with patients living in 'intelligent' homes. >http://www.hserc.ualberta.ca/Resources/Spaces/SmartCondo.aspx


**Project Purpose**
===================

This project's goal was to develop a code that provides users a method to add and retrieve different annotations in order to enhance the exploration of the Smart Condo's virtual 3D model. The keyboard's arrow keys are utilized to move the first-person controller while the mouse's cursor rotates the camera's direction of view. 


**Opening & Running Project File**
==================================

The Smart Condo Annotations is a Unity Project file. Upon opening the file in Unity (choose the folder "SmartCondoVR"), open the scene named "Condo". The way that the components of the annotation window are positioned, the Game window must be full-screen horizontally. After pressing play, position your mouse cursor to the slight left of the centre of the Game window in order to rotate the camera's view effectively. Hovering the cursor over an object in the model will bring up its annotations. Moving the mouse to point at different objects switches the annotations to the object that is currently being looked at. Use the arrow keys to position the first-person controller and the mouse together to explore the condo in this way.

**XML File**
============

The XML file is named "AnnotationsInfo" and is stored within the Resoures folder of the Assets folder in the Unity project. For organizational purposes, the text for the annotations have been categorized by their location. The brackets detailing different list element numbers are for guidance and to ensure that the correct annotations are found by the code by matching the list element numbers in the XML file and in the Update function. 

**Note**: The list element numbers always begin with 0.

**Scripts**
===========

All scripts are located wihtin the Scripts folder of the Assets folder in the Unity project.

**_camMouseLook.cs_** 

This script is attached to the main camera of the scene which is also parented under the first-person controller.  It enables the camera to rotate up, down, right and left. By using linear interpolation, the script makes the camera movements smooth. 

**_CharacterController.cs_**

This script is attached to the capsule named "FPC" in the hierarchy and enables the controller to move forward, back, left and right. 

**_ReadAnnotationName.cs & ReadAnnotationInfo.cs_**

These scripts are attached to the UI text elements of the annotation window. The code creates a list that Unity can access. After looping through each set of nodes by tag names within the XML, this data is stored inside the list, "ListofAnnotations". The code then calls for the function "getAnnotations" within the "AnnotationsInfoObject" script in order to retrieve this data (text) as needed by the Update function. 

The Update function declares string variables in order to instantiate the text for the annotations on the window. By using a 3D object's name (displayed in the hierarchy), the corresponding list element number and the tag name of the node, the name or information about the object can be displayed on the annotation window. 

The raycast originates from the camera and its direction is dependent on the position of the mouse cursor. Upon hitting a collider (that is attached to a certain gameObject), the ray will return the gameObject's name as it is displayed in the hierarchy. Utlizing this name within the code, the correct name/information of that object can be found within the xml and then displayed. The code lines "annotation.text" instruct the code to instantiate this text while annotation1, annotation2, etc. pertain to the specific segment of the XML that has the corresponding name/information of the object the raycast has hit during runtime.

The reason for having two scripts for both names and information of the gameObjects is for the purpose of being able to format the two different parts of the annotation differently. Thus, the name text is larger and bold while the information text is smaller and not bolded. Otherwise, formatting is unavailable. 

**_AnnotationsInfoObject.cs_**

This script grabs the string text within the XML file when its function, getAnnotations, is called by ReadAnnotationName.cs and ReadAnnotationInfo.cs.

**Adding New Annotations**
==============================

**_Adding new furniture/devices/objects into model_**

The Smart Condo model was completed before the annotation project. Please contact for more help and guidance.

**_Adding new box colliders_**

In order for the annotations to be displayed, the GameObject must have a collider on it that the raycast can hit. Placing a collider can be done in this manner:

1. In the hierarchy, click on the name of the object that needs annotations. Clicking on the GameObject in the Scene window will highlight its name in the hierarchy. However, most times, it will be a single component of the object that has been clicked, thus it will be the component's name that will be highlighted instead. Regardless, the component will be parented under the overall object name (name of object) that can be seen in the hierarchy as well at this point. Ensure that it is the parent name (the object's actual name) that is selected.

**Note**: This is so unless the case is otherwise. Please read "Current List of Objects with Annotations". 

2. After the object has been selected, in the Inspector window, click "Add Component". Within the search bar that appears, type in to find "Box Collider" and select it. 

3. Most times, the box collider will be fitted to the GameObject itself, thus adding the box collider would then be completed. However, if resizing is needed to make it easier for the ray to hit the collider or if the collider has not been fitted correctly, resizing can be done using the Inspector. 
  * "Center" refers to the exact center of the box collider. Translations are done along either of the three axis.
  * Changing values in "Size" alters the size of the collider in two, opposite directions along any of the axis. 

**Note**: To see which axis in which changes must be made, you can refer to the gizmo axis located in the top, right hand corner of the Scene window. The different axis colours correspond witht the axis colours of the GameObject's gizmo. 

**_Adding a new annotation to the XML file_**

Adding a new node to the list can be done in the exact same way as the previous annotations (as seen within the file). It may be inserted anywhere. However, inputting a new annotation within the file (between nodes) will require the list element numbers within the XML and within the two scripts (ReadAnnotationName.cs & ReadAnnotationInfo.cs) to be renumbered. Thus, from the point in the XML that has been changed and downwards, with each new additional annotation, the list element numbers will increase by 1. 

If an annotation is added to the end of the XML, the renumbering can be disregarded.

**_Adding the new annotation to the scripts_**

Edits will need to be made within both scripts named "ReadAnnotationName.cs" and "ReadAnnotationInfo.cs". It is the same process to add a new annotation for both.

If a new annotation was added between existing nodes within the XML, the list element numbers will be need to be renumbered as described before. Reunumbering will need to be done in the list of declared string variables and then within the if-statements that instantiate the annotation text (change the annotation#). 

**Deleting Annotations**

**Editing Annotation Information**
==================================

**Current List of Objects with Annotations**
============================================

Below are the names of the objects within the model that currently have annotations. These names appear as is within Unity's hiearachy as well as the scripts, ReadAnnotationName.cs and ReadAnnotationInfo.cs. However, any bullets with brackets beside them do not have the same name as the annotation window displays. Due to unsuccessful attempts to place a collider over the entire object (hitting the object with the ray did not produce any annotation), colliders have only been placed on certain components, thus the names of these components (that are displayed in the hierarchy) are used in the script to retrieve the entire object's annotations from the XML. Despite this, the general name of the object is displayed by the annotation window as it is stored within the XML file.
